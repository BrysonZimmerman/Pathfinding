# HierarchicalPathfinding
A senior project turned ongoing experiment. Builds a grid maze then pathfinds using A* and the Manhattan heuristic. Also demonstrates points where following runtime theory causes significant issues.

Possible future improvements include hierarchical A*, optional diagonal movement, conditional teleports, and moving teleport locations.
