# HierarchicalPathfinding
A senior project turned ongoing experiment. Builds a grid maze then pathfinds using A* and the Manhattan heuristic. This project is built to demonstrate the importance of understanding how the language handles data when choosing data structures. In this case, mitigation of pointers in data structures is critical to prevent cache misses.

Possible future improvements include hierarchical A*, optional diagonal movement, conditional teleports, and moving teleport locations.
