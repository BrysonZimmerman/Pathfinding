# HierarchicalPathfinding
A senior project turned ongoing experiment. Builds a grid maze then pathfinds using A* and the Manhattan heuristic. Builds, solves, and prints a maze to console. Project is set up to perform benchmarking for comparison purposes. Includes multiple data structures to demonstrate the differences in performance, in this case due to memory locality.

Possible future improvements include hierarchical A*, optional diagonal movement, conditional teleports, and moving teleport locations.


primmaze2.exe was developed by a friend and included here for benchmarking comparison purposes
